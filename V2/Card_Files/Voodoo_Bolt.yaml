description: 'A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make
  a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force
  damage.\n\nThe spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two
  beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You
  can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack
  roll for each beam.'
